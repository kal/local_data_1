The building was a four-storey gabled building with a single bay which was located on the north side of Peter Street. The entrance was centrally placed in the shopfront which formed the ground floor. The fenestration in the remaining floors was formed by casements. A tall chimney stack projected from the roof on its west side. It was apparently built as a part of the same development as the adjacent building, No.16 which stood on its east side. The building was demolished at the end of the first decade of the twentieth-century to make way for the Queen's Picture House, which opened in 1910."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
