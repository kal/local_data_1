The structure was built some time after 1877 to a design by the architect Joseph Parker. It was a two-storey, L-shaped building of Pennant sandstone rubble with openings edged in brick.\r\nIn the Norfolk Avenue, south-east facing, elevation there were three windows at semi-basement level (on the east side of the elevation). At the west end of the elevation was an arch which had formed the main vehicular access to into the factory. The arch was flanked on each side by Pennant sandstone pilasters and the voussoirs were of ashlar freestone. On the eastern side of this another, smaller, access was created. There were four windows at first-floor only one had not been altered. A string course of dentilated brick divided the first and second storey and above there were six second-storey windows. In the north-west facing elevation narrow lancet windows provided illumination to the semi-basement.\r\nThe basement contained a toilets in the western arm of the building, a \"Grip floor\" at the western corner and a dining hall at the northern end. At ground-floor there were separate but adjacent entrances in the east side of the arched haulingway. To the north of these was the fitting floor. The first floor against Nofolk Avenue was the ironing room.\r\nBy 2000 the building was derelict and only the shell walls remained (Morton & Oakey 2000, 20)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
