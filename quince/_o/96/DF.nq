Now built up - no trace of earthwork. The \"way near Aldebury of Knowle\" is mentioned in a Bristol charter of 1188, and Rocque's map of 1742 names the junction of the Bath Road and the Wells Road as Aldeburyham. The subsequent name of the same hill-top, Totterdown, may refer to its secondary use as a look-out hill, perhaps by the Saxons."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
