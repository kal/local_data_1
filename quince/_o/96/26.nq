The almshouse was founded by Thomas White D.D. in 1613 and consisted of ten individual residences (Manchee 1831, 518). White set down regulations for the management of the almshouse in the same year (Manchee 1831, 518-521).\r\nThe original range of almshouse was a jettied structure of three-storeys. Bays to ground-floor with entrance between, all boarded below; Gothic arch to right, heavily-moulded, capitals to jambs. Bays to first-floor, 6-light mullion & transom, large arms between; full-width pentice roof over. Two cross-windows to second-floor; cornice and boxed exterior gully; brackets to eaves. Stack at southern end. Rear elevation of 2 storeys with one large gable. To left, end of passage from gothic arch at front; in centre, wide corbelled canted bay window, mullions and transom, 14-light, 2-light to sides; individual hipped roof. At first-floor two 2-light windows. Right-hand end of rear elevation obscured by range along north side of yard. \r\nThe range on the north side of the yard was of 2 storeys with series of gables, a covered walkway with pentice roof running along the front of the ground-floor.\r\nThe almshouse is reported to have been \"damaged and part blown down\" in 1703 and subsequently rebuilt, probably in 1705 (Manchee 1831, 117). A further fourteen apartments were later added. These were described in the early-nineteenth century as \"ranging with the old ones. This more recent part of the structure has been erected at various times, as the finances of the establishment have enabled the governors to build them\" (Manchee 1831, 119).\r\nThe building fronting Temple Street (NGR ST 59250 72828), drawn by Hugh O'Neill in 1821, was removed in August 1824. A replacement building as constructed in 1824-1825. This was a two-storey; three-bay building in a Tudor style with a crenellated parapet and castellated miniature turrets at the ends. There was a central two-centred arched doorway in a square head with decorated spandrels, and drip moulding. Above, this there was a corbelled bay window.\r\nThe rear blocks were rebuilt in 1882 to increase the accomodation to 32 persons and depicted in a drawing by Loxton in c.1900 (Bryant, 2008, 8, figs, 16-18)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
