The kilns were in existence by the early 1880s and were probably producing lime for the adjacent mortar mill (SMR 10400). The kilns had been demolished by the early twentieth century and the site redeveloped for housing."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
