The building is the earliest surviving house in King Street. The land between the lane on the east side of the Old Library (BUAD 14M) and St. Nicholas Almshouses (BUAD 17M) was leased to Thomas Wickham, carpenter, by the Corporation in 1650 on condition that he built six messuages within ten years. No.33 King Street had been constructed by 1658. In 1673 the buildings on Wickham's plot were leased to Robert Dowding, ropemaker. No.33, and \"a sellar adjoining\", was at that time occupied by Robert Cary, grocer. A new lease was issued to John Freke, gentleman, in 1688 and the house was apparently then in the possession of Jacob Beel, merchant (BRO 04335(7) fo.82). By 1700 it was occupied by John Templeman, mariner. Freke's lease reverted to the Corporation in 1716 and in the following year it was leased to Thomas Seed, hooper. From 1739 Seed leased the property on a yearly basis and occupied it himself.\r\nThe building is a jettied, gabled house of three storeys, attic and basement. The side and rear walls are of stone rubble and the rear wall of the house is likely to be founded on the remains of the town wall known as the Marsh Wall.\r\nThe main, south-facing, elevation is timber-framed. The ground-floor has three windows and a doorway, the first-floor has a bay window, the second a pair of windows, with a single window at attic level. On the ground floor is a probably contemporary chimney-piece. The ceiling of the front first-floor room has good plaster decoration in two sections separated by a chamfered beam, with pointed central quatrefoils and pomegranites, winged cherubs and corner decoration. Around the upper part of the walls is a frieze of adorsal hounds and fruit.\r\nPlans of the house associated with alterations were made in 1956 and 1985 and the cellar was surveyed by John Bryant in 1980 (BUAD 374). A further survey was made by Dr. Roger Leech of the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England in 1993 (BUAD 2044; Leech 1997).\r\nThe building has a Grade II* listing (Listed Building number 901-1/16/607). There is a photograph of the exterior of the building in the SMR Collection of Ground-based photographs, No.1341."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
