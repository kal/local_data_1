It is possible that this structure is the same as that shown on Millerd's 1715 map of Bristol that depicts a large two storey building with end stacks within a large walled garden. The 1828 plan indicates that the frontage of the building consisted of three bow bays. The house is likely to have originated as a single dwelling, but by 1828 the building had been subdivided in two properties. The building was demolished for the construction of the King Edward VII Memorial Infirmary in the early 20th century."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
