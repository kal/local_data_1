The hospital is recorded by the Ordnance Survey first edition 1:2500 plan (Somerset Sheet VI.10) published in 1886. At that date the hospital comprised a narrow walled enclosure with a buildings at the north end and at the centre. Access was via a lane from the north-west corner which ran west to Novers Hill. The hospital was extant in 1916 but a new hospital, the Novers Hill Hospital for Infectious Diseases, had been constructed immediately to the north-east around the end of the nineteenth century. The hospital was subsequently demolished and its site is currently (04/07/2002) occupied by the Florence Brown Special School."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
