The building was a house constructed in the mid-seventeenth century. It was of three storeys and attic and probably had a common rafter roof.\r\nNo.14 and No.15 King Street [BUAD 1465M] were amalgamated into a single warehouse during the nineteenth century and a new façade created. This is of Pennant sandstone ashlar and squared rubble, with red brick and limestone dressings and has a four-window range. The ground-floor windows are in segmental-arched openings while rhe upper floor is divided by four two-storey semicircular-arched recesses, with alternate brick and limestone dressings. Several of the internal walls of both buildings appear to have been removed at the same time to create open-plan spaces and cast-iron columns (with flanges to pillows and timber floor beams) seven bays deep support the first-floor. The seventeenth-century second and third floors were also removed and a new floor for the warehouse inserted at a level between them.\r\nThe northern part of the seventeenth century building is in part extant. The former east wall of No.14 survives and contains a seventeenth-century chimney breast. The roof against the street front is hipped with a gable at its south end.\r\nThe building has a Grade II listing (Listed Building number 901-1/16/600)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
