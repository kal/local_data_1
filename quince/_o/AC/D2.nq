The structure was of two-storeys, apparently of rendered stone rubble, and was one of the hostelries confirmed and authorised in 1606. The building was demolished about 1883 and large wrought-iron lamp bracket from the building [1009A] was saved, and presented to the city in c.1908.\r\nThe site had been redeveloped for Messrs. Mardon's factory by 1908."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
