The villa was discovered in 1899, during the construction of a new road to the east of \"Lynwood\" (ST 616710) in the garden of which Romano-British pottery had earlier been found. Barker  (1899, 291) states the remains were situated in a field on the northern side of the present Bath Road, about half a mile beyond Arnos Vale Cemetery. The front elevation of the villa was estimated as being fifty yards back from the current position of the main road. Wick Lane was about fifty yards to the east, while to the west was the garden of \"Lynwood\".   \r\nThe site was excavated in advance of development by the Clifton Antiquarian Club and the Bristol Museum Committee, who uncovered a probable villa dating to the late 3rd-century AD (Barker 1900; 1901). The level of the whole site had been covered with a large amount of rubble. Aaccording to Barker, its deposition was \"comparatively recent\" (Barker 1900, 291) and the rubble may therefore have arrived on the site as a result of alterations to the nearby Bath Road. The construction of the new roadway divided the villa into two portions which made it difficult for the excavators to prepare a complete plan.\r\nThe foundations of the villa measured approximately 120 feet [37 metres] from east to west and were 70 feet [21.4 metres] wide, and excavation revealed a group of rectangular chambers of various sizes. Evidence of hypocausts and tessellated pavements was recorded. The villa was a winged corridor type, which was south-facing with at least ten rooms and a small bath area. Branigan (1969, 18) suggests that the building began as a suite of five rooms, possibly with no interconnecting corridor. He then suggests the villa acquired, in the following sequence, its projecting wing rooms and front corridor, a rear corridor and two rooms projecting north, a small bath suite and finally an extended suite of baths. It was destroyed c.370A.D (Russell and Williams 1984, 23).\r\nQuantities of iron and glass slag were recovered, implying that small-scale manufacturing was taking place within the site. Barker lists the finds made during the excavation, and these include coins, pottery, glassware, bronze artefacts and animal remains. Two of the mosaics were recovered; one is exhibited at Bristol Museum and Art Gallery and the other is at Kings Weston Villa\r\nAn archaeological watching brief in 1996 (SMR 20031) at No.631 Bath Road to the south of the excavated area recorded no evidence of the villa (Bryant 1996), although field evaluation immediately to the east of the villa in 2005 (SMR 22174) did record in situ Roman features (Cullen 2005)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
