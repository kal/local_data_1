The date of origin of the farm is not known but it was originally known as Pen Park Farm. The farm was in existence by the early 1840s and was recorded by the 1841 tithe survey of Westbury-on-Trym. The farm appears to have consisted of the farmhouse to the east and a yard enclosed by outbuildings on the west. An additional cottage, Brenty Farm Cottage (SMR 22326), was built approximately 400 metres to the south at the end of the nineteenth century.\r\nBy 1927 the owner was a Mr. H. L. Hardwicke (BRO EP/A/22/StSSM/1) but the site was sold to the Bristol Corporation in April of that year and the farm subsequently demolished to enable housing development."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
