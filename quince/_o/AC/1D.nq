The quarry is recorded by the Ordnance Survey first edition 1:2500 plan (Gloucestershire Sheet LXXII.06) published in 1882 as \"Old Quarry\", suggesting that it had been out of use for some time. The quarry was later infilled and is now beneath the northern part of College Court."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
