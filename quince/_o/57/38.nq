A building stood on the site from at least the mid-fifteenth century and in 1463 it was the tenement of John Viell. By 1544 it had become \"the Starre\" and was part of the lands of Lord Lisle. It had been acquired by the Corporation by 1556/7 and was leased out (Leech, 1997 78-79).\r\nThe building occupied a 4.4 metre wide frontage on High Street. The main, north-east facing, elevation was four storeys and two bays. The ground floor was a shop front and the fenestration above comprised sash windows. There was a flat element on the east side of the roof with a rail or balustrade along the eaves on the eastern side. The function of this is not clear, although it may have been a small viewing platform [1124A]. The frontage appeared to be of late eighteenth- or early nineteenth-century date, although it is likely to represent a refronting of an earlier building.\r\nThe building survived into the twentieth century but was totally destroyed by bombing during the raid on 24 November 1940. The site was subsequently redeveloped and is now beneath No.35-38 High Street."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
