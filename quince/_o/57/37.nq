Braikenridge (Notes,G.32) gives the following information:-\r\n1826 \".. the Gallery of Arts, now so called being the late Shiercliff Library & now the Property of a Mr.Walker, the Nephew of Mr.Shiercliff who has new fronted the house the several rooms of which are let out as occasions offer for travelling exhibitions of Pictures or other works of art. [In a later hand] Theses Premises have been called in succession the Gallery of Arts, The Bazaar & the New Exchange & was burnt down on 19 Feby 1827. Mr.Walker had expended upwards of £4000 on these premises & they were only insured at £1500\". \r\nHe also states (Notes L26) that it was let out as an occasional sale room. \r\nIn 1828 (Rowbotham's drawing, BRSMG M2915) there was, at the apex of the pediment, a plinth, atop which appears to have been a statue. There was also a circular feature, probably a window, within the pediment."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
