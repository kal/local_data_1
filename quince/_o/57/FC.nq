The concert hall was constructed between 1863 and 1867 on the site of the Great House (BUAD 420M) and opened in 1868 (Meller 1976, 57-58). The interior of the original auditorium was recorded in a series of drawings by Samuel Loxton (Bristol Reference Library D181-D186). The building suffered a serious fire on 1 September 1898 which destroyed the auditorium (Winstone 1983, Pls.89-90). The auditorium was subsequently reconstructed but the hall was damaged by incendiaries during the Second World War. It was again rebuilt and remains in use as a concert hall."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
