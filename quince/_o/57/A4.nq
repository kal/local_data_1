The hospital was founded in the early-thirteenth century - probably between 1232 and 1234 (Price 1998, 53) - by Sir John de la Warr on the site of a Norman first-floor aisled hall (BUAD 1120M) he owned. The hospital occupied a narrow curving site between a cliff and the River Frome. The entrance gate stood on Host Street with the chapel and infirmary immediately behind. To the north-west of this was the master's lodging and to the north the kitchen and refectory, bakehouses and dormitories. The burial ground occupied the remainder of the parcel to the north-east, although inhumations were also excavated in a courtyard area at the southern end of the site between the chapel, master's lodging and Narrow Lewins Mead.\r\nSt. Bartholomew's Hospital was transferred in January 1531/2 from the de la Warre family to the ownership of John and Robert Thorne established a grammar school on the site. The existing almoners were allowed to live out their remaining lives there.\r\nThe site was archaeologically excavated in 1977 (BUAD 3286)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
