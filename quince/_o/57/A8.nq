The building was a jettied, gabled house of three storeys.\r\nFront apparently much altered. Entrance to alley on left; window; two (?) doorways on right, with large bracket beyond. Glazing to full width of first-floor, with left end projecting and small window to its left return. All windows mullioned casements with no transoms. Oriel window, 5 lights, to second-floor, top of window flush with eaves. Decorative bargeboards, removed to ornament one gable of Braikenridge's 'Cottage Lodge'. Pantile roof. \r\nThe rear view, from the courtyard, shows a building truncated, with remains of walls and a pile of building timbers. Arch-braced roof truss visible. Pair of rough doors to ground-floor, alley to street on right; large 4-light mullion and transom repositioned window at first-floor, the lights being wider than they are tall, doorway with 9-panel door to right; canted oriel window to second-floor, with 8 lights and transom, and 2 lights to each side. \r\nA 'water-spout' and 2 fragments of a chimney-piece were drawn by O'Neill (M2293).\r\nBetween Husenbeth's Provision Warehouse, to the west, and David Morris's porter cellars, to the east. A sign on the latter gives the number as 15, Baldwin Street, whereas directories give 13. Occupied by S. Bird, Turner in 1821, who is listed at No.13 by the directories.\r\nThe building was demolished on 31 July 1823."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
