The southern part of the gasometer base was built of stone and stood approximately three metres high and two metres wide. This was demolished in late August 1997 as part of the construction of the Bristol Children's Hospital."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
