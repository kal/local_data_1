The building was in existence by 1828 and was constructed as the eastern of a pair with No.87 Wilder Street (BUAD 1495M). The building was a two-storey, single bay house. By 1883 it had been incorporated into a larger industrial building constructed to the rear. No.2 Cave Street Cottages appears to have survived as part of this structure until at least 1950 but was subsequently demolished."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
