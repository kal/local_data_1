The house was extant by the time of the Brislington tithe survey of 1846 and was also recorded by the Ordnance Survey 1st edition 1:2500 scale plan of Brislington of 1884. The latter indicates that Lanesborough House lay on the east side of a lane which largely follows the line of modern Broomhill Road. The house was located towards the southern edge of the plot and had a driveway leading off the lane around its east and west sides. The house was still in existence in 1961 according to the Ordnance Survey 1:1250 plan, although the front, west-facing elevation, had apparently by then been remodelled. The house has since been demolished and its site now lies towards the southern side of a block of open land on the east side of Broomhill Road."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
