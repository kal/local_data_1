Brick with limestone dressings, tile-hung bay, and a pantile gabled roof. Double-depth plan. Queen Anne style. 3 storeys and attic; 1-bay range. A tall, narrow frontage with a coped gable has a late C20 shop front with 4-panel doors either side of a wide tripartite window, rendered side piers with cartouches at the top and a bracketed cornice between; first-floor brick piers to moulded second-floor capitals, beneath square panelled bases to octagonal ball finials either side of the attic gable; first- and second-floor shallow canted bay set flush with the front, has a plate-glass tripartite central window on the first floor, similar glazing with an Ipswich window on the second floor, with a low plaster pediment with side brackets and tile-hung backing in between; over the bay is a 2-centre moulded brick arch on curved brackets with a tile-hung tympanum after sprocketed eaves, and 2-light casement windows; the brick gable above has ashlar bands, a roll-top coping and a tall square ball finial. \r\nThe building was renovated in 1988, when a shop fascia board  '22 A. C. Budden 22' , of c.1895, was revealed. The east wall of the building was in an orange-pink mortar. The main east side wall of the cellar was of stone rubble, also in an orange-pink mortar, and thought to be medieval in date. The outbuildings in the long rear yard have been demolished, but a surface of grooved Pennant Sandstone flags survived, laid square in late nineteenth-century fashion.\r\nThe building has a Grade II listing (Listed Building number 901-1/12/1635)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
