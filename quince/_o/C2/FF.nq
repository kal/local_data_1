The building was of two storeys and basement. The main, north-east facing, elevation which fronted on to Exchange Avenue was a simple Classical design, of two storeys with three bays. A central entrance between two tall windows, a segmental pediment above the doorway, and blind balustrading below the windows. At the first-floor were 3 windows with eared and shouldered architraves, a above which was a cornice and shallow parapet. The hall occupied the principal storey, with offices below and an anatomical-theatre above. From about 1745 the building was leased as a coffee-house, later becoming \"The Grapes\" tavern. It was gutted during the Blitz and the front was removed soon afterwards. Ison (1952 92; fig.7) reproduces a drawing of the main elevation."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
