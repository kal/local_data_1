The precise location of the chapel is unknown although it was described by the antiquary William Worcestre in 1480 as being \"quasi versus fratres sancti francisci\". The dedication is similarly uncertain. Worcestre reports the chapel as being 10 paces square, built of freestone with eight buttresses. The windows were also of freestone and the roof was tiled (Neale 2000, 194-195; 210-211). A tiled pavement discovered in 1894 during demolition of the White Lion public house (BUAD 104) was thought Robert Hall Warren to be the floor of this chapel, but this is very unlikely."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
