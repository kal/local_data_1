The quarry was recorded by the Ordnance Survey first edition 1:2500 plan (Somerset Sheet VI.07) published in 1886. The quarry measures 113 metres from east to west by 68 metres north-south and the working face was at its western end. There was a limekiln (SMR 21141) at the eastern end. The quarry had apparently gone out of use by the beginning of the twentieth century and is recorded by the Ordnance Survey second edition plan published in 1905 as \"Old Quarry\". The site has now been infilled and redeveloped for housing."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
