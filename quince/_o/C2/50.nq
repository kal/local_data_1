Jean Rocque's 1742 map records the \"Fish Market\" standing at what is now the north-western corner of St. Stephens Street and at the back of 'The Keys Head'. The map shows a rectangular building within a larger demarcated, possibly fenced, area. The fish market is presumably alluded to in the name of \"Fish Lane\" by which St. Stephen's Street is marked on Millerd's 1673 map, suggesting that the presence of the market on this site was well established by the later seventeenth-century."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
