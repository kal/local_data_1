The church was constructed in 1851 to a design by John Norton and had accommodation for 830 worshippers (Ralph & Cobb 1991, 30).\r\nThe church was in a Gothic style and consisted of a nave with a gabled roof and aisles beneath pentice roofs. The nave was 80 feet 9 inches (24.71 metres) long from east to west and 49 feet (15 metres) wide internally. The octagonal font was sited toward the western end of the south aisle (at ST 59486 73381), just off the . There was a square tower at the west end of the church with angle buttresses. This was not completed, but finished with a pyramidal roof. The design intended that tower would contain moveable benches for children's seating.\r\nIn 1888 a new organ was built for the church by the Bristol-based organ builders W. G. Vowles. This was moved to the church of St. Jude the Apostle (BUAD 916M) in Lamb Street, presumably in the 1940s (it is now in St. George's Anglican Church on Orleana Square in Gawler, a town north of the Australian city of Adelaide).\r\nThe church was closed in June 1940 and was demolished in 1949."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
