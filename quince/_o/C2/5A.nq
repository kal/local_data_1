The building, on the west side of the street, was a wide three-storey, single-bay jettied house with a front gable and pantiled roof. The ground floor was a shopfront with a central doorway which had large lights adjacent. The first floor contained a large bay window as did the second storey. There were windows in the north wall of the building at first and second floors. These were at the extreme east end of the building. There also appears to have been a small gable on this side of the house.\r\nThe building was occupied in the 1890s by H. R.
