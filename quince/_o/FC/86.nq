A tombstone and associated inhumation had been found in 1873 (SMR 20145) on the site. The cemetery was dated on the basis of ceramic evidence to 75-125AD. Cremation appears to have occurred elsewhere with a token volume of remains then collected and deposited in shallow pits in the rock together with pottery vessels. This burial practice appeared to have been consistently followed throughout the period of the cemetery's use.\r\nThe cemetery was discovered as a result of archaeological excavation in advance of development; its limits were not defined. The site has been built over for housing and it is likely that the archaeology has been destroyed or badly disturbed by foundations beneath the houses. Evidence may, however, survive in the gardens of the houses."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
