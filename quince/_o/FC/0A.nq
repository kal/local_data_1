The building was located on the east side of Oldbury Court Road. It was founded by Dr. Joseph Mason in 1740. Mason died in 1779 but the hospital continued to operate until the mid-nineteenth century.\r\nRelatively little is currently known about the form and operation of the hospital in the eighteenth century. However, an inquiry for the Gloucestershire Court or Quarter Sessions into the hospital in November and December 1848 recorded some evidence about its methods at that date. The superintendent of the hospital was then Dr. Joseph Carpenter Bompas who had taken over the licence for the institution after his father's death in 1847. The building had three departments, apparently single rooms. The first department was \"the middle department of the house, where the gentlemen are\" (Anon. 1848, 97). The second department was known as the \"Farmer's Department\" and was where middle-class patients were housed, while the third department was for the \"sick and noisy\" (Anon. 1848, 97). There were other restraint rooms, including a secure room known as the strong room, and an exercise yard surrounded by high walls (Anon 1848, 98).\r\nThe asylum closed in 1852 and the building was demolished in the 1880s."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
