The date of construction of the lodge is unknown but it was in existence by 1742 when it was recorded by Jean Rocque's map of Bristol. The building was an \"L-haped\" structure orientated south-west to north-east, with a rectangular formal garden (SMR 21906) on its north-eastern side. On the north-west side of this was an orchard (SMR 21907). The lodge was reached via an avenue of trees from Cotham Brow, the entrance of which was flanked by two extant stone obelisks (SMR 21896 & SMR 21897).\r\nThe lodge had been demolished by 1828 and a new house (SMR 21910) constructed immediately to its north-east, on the edge of the formal garden."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
