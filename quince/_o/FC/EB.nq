The building is a rendered two-storey, four bay house with a pitched pantile roof. A two-storey rear range runs north from the east-west block on the Crew's Hole Road fontage. The building is of probable eighteenth-century date but was refronted in the early-nineteenth century. It was first recorded by the St. George tithe survey of 1842 (BRO EP/A/32/32)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
