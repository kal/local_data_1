At the ends of the rows of pits (at ST56557428 and ST56777519) are the remains of two tumuli. South of the Pembroke Road quarry and opposite the entrance to the Zoological Gardens (at ST569743 and ST567741) are the remains of two pounds or village enclosures {1} \"Dr Prowse...thinks that the mounds and hollows on the downs at Clifton are indications of ancient settlements. It is impossible to say that none of these mounds are ancient but on the other hand it appears certain that many of them are the natural outcrop of limestone ridges, and that others are caused by excavations made to discover lead... I can see no evidence of the existence of the two tumuli...or the two pounds or village enclosures?. {2}running shafts {3}"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
