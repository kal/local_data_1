The burial ground is surrounded by a high rubble wall of probable eighteenth-century date. The entrance arch is on Kingsweston Lane and there is a stone above bearing the legend \"FRIENDS BURIAL GROUND 1696\" (datestones were placed on most Quaker burial grounds following advice issued in 1870, the date given normally being that of the earliest deed for the land parcel held). Brick arches (now blocked) of unknown purpose are set in the south-west and south-east facing boundary walls at the junction of Kingsweston Lane and Broadlands Drive.\r\nThe boundary wall of the cemetery has a Grade II listing (Listed Building number 901-1/24/1567)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
