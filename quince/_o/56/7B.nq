The statue is by the Indian sculptor Niranjan Pradhan and comprises a figure of the Raja Rammohun Roy which faces west, and stands on a stone plinth.\r\nRam Mohum Roy Badahoor was born in Radhanagar, Bengal on 22 May 1772. He worked for the East India Company between 1804 and 1814 and learned Persian and English, which were the official languages of the Company's administrative structure. Roy had a strong interest in religious matters and learned Arabic, Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, and Hebrew to further his studies of the fundamental texts of the great world religions. He held strongly to a monotheistic religious viewpoint, arguing against both Hindu worship of gods and goddesses and the Christian doctrine of the Holy Trinity. In 1828 Roy founded the religious movement Brahmo Samaj (the Society of Brahma), the aim of which was to establish the worship of the Supreme Being. He also sought reform of the caste system and an improvement of the social status of women and children. In particular, with William Carey, he helped to persuade the Governor General of India, William Bentinck, to abolish suttee (the practice of burning a widow on her husband's funeral pyre) in 1829. In 1830, Roy became the envoy of the Emperor of Delhi to England. In April 1831 Roy arrived in England, primarily to witness the renewal of the East India Company charter, but he also attended the coronation of William IV. Roy travelled to Bristol in 1833 to visit Dr. Lant Carpenter, the Minister of the Unitarian Chapel at Lewin's Mead and father of the educational reformer Mary Carpenter. He stayed with other members of the Unitarian congregation at Stapleton but developed symptoms of meningitis and died there on 27 September 1833. His remains were initially interred in Stapleton but were moved to Arno's Vale cemetery in 1843.\r\nThe statue was unveiled on 20 December 1997 by the Indian High Commissioner (Merritt 2002, 59). A bronze plaque on the plint bears the legend \"RAJAH RAMMOHUN ROY / BORN ON 22 MAY 1772 IN RADHANAGAR BENGAL / DIED ON 27 SEPTEMBER 1833 IN BRISTOL / PHILOSOPHER, REFORMER, PATRIOT, SCHOLAR / A FOUNDING FATHER OF INDIAN RENAISSANCE / UNVEILED BY HIS EXCELLENCY DR.
