The site was purchased by the Clifton diocese and a timber church dedicated to St. Brendan was established on the site in 1946, serving the local community but also seamen arriving at the port of Avonmouth and workers at nearby factories. In 1954 a scheme to construct a new church was granted planning permission and the timber church was dismantled in 1955. Father Norman Fisher of the Portsmouth diocese, whose family lived in Redland, had brought back a piece of rock from the shrine commemorating St. Brendan's voyage to America in County Kerry and this was set in the foundations of the new building. The new church was opened and blessed by the Bishop of the Clifton diocese, Joseph Rudderham, in late January 1956.\r\nThe church is a single-storey structure constructed of brick in a Romanesque style with a pitched roof. There is a campanile at the north-west corner of the building. Internally, the Stations of the Cross were donated by a local businessman, Jack Smith.\r\nThe last mass was held in the church on 1 February 2004."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
