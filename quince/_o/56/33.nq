The building was a jettied, gabled house of three storeys, dating to the mid-seventeenth century. It was almost certainly constructed as part of the redevelopment of the site of Bristol Castle after its demolition in the late 1650s.\r\nBy the beginning of the nineteenth century a shop had been created at ground-floor. During the later-nineteenth century he building was occupied by T. Goldesbrough, tobacconist. The building was almost entirely destroyed by a fire that began late on the evening of Saturday, May 18th 1907 and burned well into the following day (Whit-Sunday). As a result of the fire damage, The building was very extensively rebuilt as an architecturally plain brick structure."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
