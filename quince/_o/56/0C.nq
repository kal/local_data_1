The school was constructed after 1828 but was in existence by the time of the Ordnance Survey first edition 1:500 plan (Bristol Sheet LXXVI.1.2) surveyed in 1883. This plan records that the school was for both boys and girls. The school survived into the early-twentieth century but had been demolished and the site redeveloped by the mid-1960s."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
