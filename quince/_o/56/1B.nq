The orphanage was located in Ashley Manor House until it moved to a site on the east side of Ashley Hill in 1829. There was a house at the north edge of the grounds (ST 59838 74682) of a similar architectural style to the main building, and probably therefore built at the same time. The orphanage was sold at auction in November 1927, the cottage and the orphanage building being disposed of in two separate lots (Bristol Reference Library 12750)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
