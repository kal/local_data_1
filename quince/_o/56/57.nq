A development of 20 three-storey houses on the south side of the entrance lock to Cumberland Basin. The housing had been constructed by c1822 and are shown in a watercolour drawing of Granby Hill by Lt. Col. William Booth of that date. The houses are recorded in more detail by a watercolour drawing by Samuel Jackson (BRSMG M970). The development comprised two adjoining terraces, one aligned parallel with the lock and the other running south-south-west from the east corner of the first, the angle of the two arms enclosing what appears to have been a cultivated space. The majority of the houses each had a small garden to the rear.\r\nBy the time of the first edition Ordnance Survey 1:500 plan surveyed in 1882 all of the houses had been demolished with the sole exception of that at the north-east corner of the development.\r\nThe site now lies largely beneath the elevated section of Brunel Lock Road."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
