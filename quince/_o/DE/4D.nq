The green was in existence by the late-eighteenth century and is recorded by name in a series of plans of the area from 1817 onwards, including the Westbury-on-Trym tithe survey of 1841 (Land Parcel 490) and belonged to the Lords of the Manor of Westbury and Henbury. The Green appears to have been common land used for pasture and presumably for herbage.\r\nA new Bishop's Palace was constructed in 1899 at the edge of the Green (within a field named Otward Brockridge). In 1902 seven and a half acres were given to Bristol Corporation and the Corporation bought out the remaining Commoners rights at a total cost of £200. The space was established as a public amenity and there appears to have been some planting, including the existing London Plane trees, and the setting up of park furniture at that date. One of the rustic cast-iron park benches, manufactured by T. P. Richards & Sons is extant. These are shown in a drawing of the Green by Samuel Loxton dating to the early twentieth century (Bristol Reference Library W1357). A further two and a half acres were given to the Corporation by the Trustees of Redland Chapel and this land was used as allotments until 1956. Between 1951 and 1953 tennis courts and a bowling green and pavilion were constructed."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
