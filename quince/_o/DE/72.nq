The building was a three-storey, two-bay house with a pantiled cross-gabled roof. The ground floor of the main, north-west facing, elevation comprised a shopfront, with two centrally-placed doorways (giving the impression that the ground floor was originally two shops which had been made into one). There were bay windows in each of the first floor bays and smaller bays in the gable end. A chimney stack projected from either end of the ridge of the roof. In the early twentieth century the ground floor was the Star Dining Rooms. The building had been demolished by the 1960s."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
