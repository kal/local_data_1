The building was a house of two-storeys and attic with a gabled pantile roof. It was probably constructed in the late-seventeenth or early-eighteenth century.\r\nThe building was demolished in 1961 (Winstone 1972, pl.129) and the site redeveloped. The building line was set back from the original position, meaning that the eastern part of the house now lies beneath the footway."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The tower was built between 1897 and 1898 to a design by W. V. Gough, and was to commemorate the quatrcentenary of John Cabot's voyage to Newfoundland.\r\nThe first stone was laid by the Marquis of Dufferin and Ava in 1897. The foundations were dug into the underlying Brandon Hill Grit, disturbing inhumations and other archaeological features. The tower stands 105 feet [32.1 metres] high is of red sandstone rubble with limestone dressings and is in a Tudor Gothic Revival style. It is a square two-stage tower with diagonal buttresses. The lower band comprises square panels, the middle band of pointed panels, and it has a machicolated cornice with a pierced balustrade. The doorway in the north side has a moulded surround and plain door, below a two-centred arched panel with a gabled label, crockets and finial, containing the city arms. There is an ashlar octagonal spirelet on top, and a ball finial with a carved figure above.\r\nThe Marquis of Dufferin opened the monument on 6th September 1898. Originally there was a cannon on each side of the projecting base of the tower. The gardens which now surround the base are a later addition.\r\nThe tower has a Grade II listing (Listed Building number 901-1/41/18)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
