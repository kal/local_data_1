The structure was of two storeys with, apparently symmetrical north-west and south-west facing elevations, five bays in each with a doorway at the centre. There were chimney stacks at the centre of the north-east and south-east sides of the building and the hipped roof had a shallow pitch. Each of the windows apparently comprised a three by four pane sash with glazing bars. The house was drawn by T. L. Rowbotham in 1826-27 (Stoddard 1981, 52).\r\nElizabeth Hurle owned the property in 1828 (Ireland Manuscript BRO St. LB/HM/1a & 1b). On the death of Elizabeth Hurle the estate and property passed to her nephew John Hurle. By 1828, he had settled West Town House on his niece Susannah and her husband Joseph Cooke. Their son Joseph Cooke assumed the surname of Hurle and succeeded to Brislington Hill House and the Cooke-Hurle estate in 1855. In the early nineteenth century a large pond was made which became known as Rylands Pond after the occupier of the house.\r\nThe house was subsequently let to a succession of wealthy families until it was purchased c.1923 by Joseph Corrigan, owner of a printing company. In 1938 some of the grounds were sold for housing development. Upon Corrigan's death in 1941, the house became a residential home for the elderly and was known as Uganda House. By 1962 the property had been converted into two dwellings.\r\nThe house is extant and is located on the east side of West Town Park. It has a Grade II listing (Listed Building number 901-1/48/469). The site of the pond is now covered by development in West Town Grove."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
