The almshouse is reputed to have been founded in 1292 by Simon Burton, mayor of Bristol, although Paterson argues that the attribution was more likely to have derived from a later mayor, John Burton who founded a chantry in St. Thomas Church which later funded repair works to the almshouse (Paterson 1939, 320-321).\r\nThe medieval form of the almshouse is uncertain but its plan appears to have been similar to the later building, though Marochan and Reed suggest it was larger than the later structure. There appear to have been a statue on either side of the main entrance, representing St. Thomas the Martyr and St. John the Baptist (Paterson 1939, 320). By 1550 there were twenty-four inmates, twelve men and twelve women.\r\nThe almshouse was rebuilt in 1606 and was rebuilt again in 1721. This structure is recorded by several nineteenth-century drawings and photographs and was a two storey building, probably of five bays. There was an entrance at the centre of the main, north-west facing, elevation above which a was large plaque under its own pediment. The legend was recorded by George Weare Braikenridge as reading: \"This Almshouse was Erected in the year 1292 For Sixteen Persons By Simon Burton Esqr & Rebuilt Anno Domini 1721 He was Five times MAYOR of this City & the Original Founder of St. Mary Redcliff Church\". The fenestration consisted of cross-windows. There was a raised area in front of the building, with access from either end through doorways and up steps. The front boundary wall was raised above these doorways and there were four arched cellar openings with grilles at the base of wall.\r\nThe almshouse was damaged by bombing during the Second World War and was demolished in the 1950s. The front wall plaque was removed to Bristol Museum, but is badly damaged. Keith Marochan and Keith Reed monitored groundworks associated with the redevelopment of the site in 1959 (BUAD 3079; Marochan and Reed 1959)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
