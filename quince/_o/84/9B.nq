The house appears to have been constructed in the seventeenth century and was a jettied, gabled structure of three-storeys and attic with a one-window range. There were a pair of entrances on the west side of the main, north-facing, elevation and the western of these openings contained a seventeenth-century panelled door. The fenestration at ground-floor level originally consisted of a ten-light transomed bay window. At first- and second-floor levels there was glazing across the full-width of the elevation and outer bay windows which had six-light windows in the front and two-light windows in the sides. The panels beneath the windows were decorated. There was an eight-light bay window in the gable at attic level and a pendant below the apex of gable. The building was recorded in a drawing by T. L. Rowbotham made in 1825 (BRSMG M2504) by which time the ground-floor bay had largely been removed. It was demolished in the late 1930s to enable the construction of the inner circuit road."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
