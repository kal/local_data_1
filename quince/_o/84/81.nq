The quarry was established by 1883 and was recorded by the Ordnance Survey 1:2500 plan of that year. It had apparently gone out of use by 1930 (BRO 40577/12-13). The purpose of the quarry is unknown, though it was presumably for stone. It is not clear whether the quarry had any relationship to the limekilns in the same field immediately to the north-west of Hengrove Farm (SMR 20305).  A tramway is marked on a map dated 1917 (BRO DD/QK C/2984 47) which is concerned with the sale of Hengrove Farm."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
