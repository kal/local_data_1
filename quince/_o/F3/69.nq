The quarry is recorded by the Ordnance Survey first edition 1:500 plan (Bristol Sheet LXXII.9.11) as an \"Old Quarry\", indicating that it was out of use by that date. The quarry was crescentic, running southwards from Effingham Road and measured approximately 30 metres wide and was around 120 metres long. The site was purchased by the Bristol Corporation in 1890 to create St. Andrew's Park (SMR 4243) and the quarry was infilled with material produced by the development of the surrounding estate (Lambert 2000, 50)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
