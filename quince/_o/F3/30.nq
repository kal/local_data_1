The marker is of cast iron and stands approximately 0.5 metres high. It was erected by the Bristol Turnpike Trust to indicate the boundary between the (out) parishes of St. Paul and St. Philip and Jacob and is dated \"1823\".\r\nThe marker appears to have been moved from its original position, likely to have been on the bridge over the river Frome 20 metres to the south-east of the present position, when the M32 was constructed."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
