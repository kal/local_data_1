The bridge crossed the River Frome between Bridewell and Turn Again Lane, now beneath Bridewell Street. Parts probably survive underground. The bridge was a single span arch with a string course immediately above the voussoirs. Tall ashlar parapets with rounded coping, the eastern parapet with a concave ramp down at its northern end. The road surface was slightly bowed."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
