The cemetery is sited on the north side of Brunswick Square and associated with the Congregational chapel adjacent to the west. The cemetery had been established by the time of Donne's map of Bristol of 1773, which records it as a \"Presbyterian Burying Ground\", although at this time its extent was limited to an area on the frontage with Brunswick Square.\r\nThe cemetery had expanded to approximately its modern extent by 1828, although Plumley and Ashmead's 1828 plan of Bristol suggests that an area at the north-east corner, measuring 32 metres north south by 22 metres wide, was not then in use for burials. A small mortuary chapel had by then been built at the centre of the burial ground (at ST 59264 73721). Surrey Lodge (BUAD 1700M) was built subsequently. The cemetery was one of those closed under the 1854 Act.\r\nInterments are known to have taken place across the site, with the greatest density in the western half (BRO 39461/P/1(a)(b)). The majority of the headstones were removed in the early 1980s.\r\nSurrey Lodge has a Grade II listing (Listed Building number 901-1/6/1885). Two groups of chest tombs have a Grade II listing (Listed Building numbers 901-1/6/1883 and 901-1/6/1884)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
