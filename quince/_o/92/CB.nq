The almshouse was established in 1778 by William Fry to provide accommodation for \"the reception and habitation of eight poor women, in eight rooms\" (Manchee, 1831 60). Fry specified that those nominated for residence \"should always be single persons; to wit, widows, or such as had not been married, and that they should continue unmarried during their abode in the said hospital under the penalty of expulsion therefrom.\" Fry also emphasised that \"none should be known to be vicious persons or drunkards, or of turbulent spirits\" (Manchee, 1831 61).\r\nThe building was constructed of stone rubble and was two-storeys in height with the main, north-facing, elevation on Colston Parade being of three bays. It was in a Gothick style. An oval panel above the main entrance doorway reads FRY'S/HOUSE OF MERCY/1784.\r\nThe building was gutted as a result of bombing during the Second World War, and was rebuilt behind the façade after the war.\r\nThe building has a Grade II listing (Listed Building number 901-1/42/1672)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
