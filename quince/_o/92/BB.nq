The Weavers' Hall, the guild hall for the Weavers, was in existence by 1299. If the identifications of the structure by J. F. Nicholls in 1869 (BUAD 3670) and by G. L. Good in 1974 are correct, it appears to have been a substantial  structure of squared stone blocks. The master's house stood immediately adjacent."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
