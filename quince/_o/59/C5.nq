The chapel appears to have been built in the late nineteenth- or early twentieth-century and is first recorded by the Ordnance Survey second edition 1:2500 plan published in 1903 (Gloucestershire Sheet LXXI.03). The site has been redeveloped for housing and the footprint of the chapel now lies partly beneath Nos.81-93 Orlebar Gardens."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
