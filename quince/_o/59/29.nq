The building was a large dwelling constructed sometime after the tithe survey of the 1840s, apparently on the site of an earlier dwelling. It is recorded by the Ordnance Survey 1st edition plan of 1880 (Ordnance Survey Glos. LXXI.12.7) which shows the house set in extensive gardens which incorporate an earlier pond (SMR 20318) and outbuildings [SMR 20319] at their eastern boundary.\r\nThe site of the building now lies beneath Nos.18 and 19 Belvedere Road."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
