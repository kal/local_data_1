The monument measured 40 feet in diameter, 2 feet high. It was excavated in 1924 by Tratman, and a cremation with parts of an Iron Age \"A\" carinated bowl was recorded. Finds included, the iron cheek piece of a bridle, two fragments of samian from under the turf, now in the University of Bristol Spelaeological Society Museum.\r\nTratman attributed the barrows on Kings Weston Hill (SMR 761, 784,785) to the Iron age. O'Neill and Grinsell (1960) imply that the Iron Age cremation may have been secondary. Though inconclusive, the excavations suggest a Late Bronze Age date for the barrow, with other material in secondary position. Three small round barrows excavated in about 1924 by Tratman seem to have contained primary cremations with Iron Age A pottery. Green briefly reviewed the dating evidence available for the barrows at Kingsweston Hill in considering a cairn he had excavated at Tickenham. On the basis of a re-examination of Tratman's pottery finds, which appeared to be from collared urns, Green concluded that \"in the absence of any structural grounds for considering the Kings Weston Hill barrows to be of Iron Age date\" the Kingsweston barrows were of Early Bronze Age origin (Green 1972-73, 43-44). Tratman replied to Green's reinterpretation, arguing that the interpretation of the pottery as Iron Age was questionable, the monuments had not necessarily been disturbed to any great extent in antiquity and that the argument that absence of structural grounds for an Iron Age date leads to the inference of a date in the Early Bronze Age was \"highly specious\". Tratman concluded that there was no good reason to redate the Kingsweston barrows until fresh evidence became available (Tratman 1975, 56-57)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
