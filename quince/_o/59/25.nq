Mid-late 15th.century. Pennant rubble and limestone dressings and stone gable-end stack. Single-depth plan, the rear overhanging the south aisle of All Saints, Corn Street. \r\n3-storeys and basement; 3-window range. The corners are chamfered at street level and the upper parts corbelled out; a central Tudor-arched doorway to All Saints Court, and a studded door; cross windows with metal casements, a 3-light window to the right on the second floor, and a single-light window over the door. First-floor room has a Tudor-arched stone fireplace; chamfered beams, with 15 WH 85 painted on one, and a covered window with trefoil head looking on to the church below; second-floor room has a similar fire place, and a 3-bay roof rebuilt c.1980 with cambered collars and ties, clasped purlins, ceiled above the collars; a small window with splayed reveals and trefoil head to the right of the fireplace. \r\nThe house is traditionally said to have been built on to the south-west corner of the church in 1422 as a parsonage. Probably remodelled in the 16th.century. Heavily restored by Oatley in 1905-6, making it difficult to fully discern the original plan."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
