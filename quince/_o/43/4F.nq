The structure was a three-storey jettied building on the north side of Peter Street. It had a hipped pantiled roof and a large chimney stack projected from its east side. The frontage had been replaced during the late eighteenth- or early nineteenth-century and the ground floor comprised a shopfront with an entrance on the west side. There was a bay window containing sashes at the first floor and a further sash at the second floor. The new facade appeared to form a parapet around the roof. It was apparently built as a part of the same development as the adjacent building, No.16 which stood on its east side."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
