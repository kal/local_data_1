The building was a jettied, gabled house of three storeys and attic with a 1-window range. It was almost certainly constructed as part of the redevelopment of the site of Bristol Castle after its demolition in the late 1650s.\r\nBy the nineteenth century the ground floor was a shop. Shop windows with a central, flush, entrance, possibly with a 2-leaf door. One canted bay each to first and second floors, sashes. A single attic window with a pivotting pane. Fretted bargeboards. Lateral stack(s) on east side.\r\nThe building was destroyed by bombing on 24 November 1940."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
