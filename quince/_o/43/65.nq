Portland Square was laid out in the late 1780s and building plots were advertised for sale from March 1790. The plots of Nos.11 and 12 Portland Square were acquired for development by James Lockier but Lockier's went into bankruptcy when the building boom collapsed in 1792. The building was completed by the architect Daniel Hague in 1811. The sale advertisement of 1812 stated that the buildings comprised \"three arched underground cellars, a servants hall, housekeeper's room, back-kitchen, larder, brew-house, and other offices, on the area floor; an entrance hall, front parlour twenty feet by twenty-two feet, two back parlours, and a garden on the ground floor; a drawing room twenty one feet by twenty seven, and two other rooms on the first storey; four rooms and a water closet on the attic storey; and four rooms on the upper storey\" (quoted in Ison 1952, 221).\r\nThe building forms part of terrace, Nos.7-13 Portland Square and is a house with a double-depth plan of three storeys plus attic with a slate mansard roof. The main, north-west facing elevation is of limestone ashlar and has three bays. The ground floor is rusticated and the upper two floors plain. The fenestration consists of sashes. There is a parapet in front of two attic dormers. At either end of the mansard, projecting from the party walls, there is a brick chimney stack. The other walls are of rendered Pennant sandstone rubble. Cellars extend beneath the house and there is a basement lightwell at the front of the house and on the northern side of this smaller cellars extend under the road. The building seems to have gone out of domestic use by the later nineteenth century and was part of the Young & Melrow Stay and Corset factory by 1877.\r\nThe building has a Grade I listing (Listed Building number 901-1/6/1901)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
