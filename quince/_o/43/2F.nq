The memorial was erected in 1920 at a cost of £600 by the residents of Fishponds. It consists of a bronze statue of a British/Dominions infantry soldier of the First World War set on a granite plinth. The statue faces south-east and immediately below its feet on this face is a bronze scroll bearing the inscription \"1914 VICTORY 1918\". On each of the four sides of the plinth are bronze plaques recording the names of those killed during the First World War. That on the south-west face records the names of members of the Gloucestershire Regiment. The plinth rests on a three-tier octagonal stone base. There is a signature on the base of the statue on the north-west face. The figure was cast by Oakes and Humphries, founders.\r\n[Public Monument and Sculpture Association reference number BR121]."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
