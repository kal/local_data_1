The site was created by the infilling of Aldsworth's Dock in the mid-seventeenth century and a building is recorded on the site by Millerd's 1673 map of Bristol.\r\nThe building was a house of late seventeenth-century date and contained an elaborately carved stone chimneypiece dated 1682. The form of the building as constructed as known although it apears to have been a single-bay structure of at least three storeys. The plot measured 13.8 metres from east to west and 6.25 metres north-south. The building appears to have been refronted in the early nineteenth century (Winstone 1960, pl.66) and the Goad fire insurance plan indicates that it was of four storeys by 1887.\r\nBy the beginning of the 1870s the building had become a public house, the licensee then being Patrick Gorey. By 1882 the licensee was J. Guzio Srichia and the building was still in use as a public house in 1891, in the tenure of John Way. It was apparently demolished soon after the closure of Alderskey Lane in 1900 (Pritchard 1904, 128-129) and the chimneypiece was retrieved. This is now in the Bristol Savages Wigwam at Red Lodge.\r\nThe site was subsequently revedeloped for the Co-operative Wholesale building. The site of the rear part was archaeologically excavated in 1979 (BUAD 442) but any evidence for the building appears to have been removed by the basements of the CWS building."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
