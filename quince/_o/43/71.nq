The farmhouse is a rendered stone rubble building with cross-gabled roof and is of probable seventeenth-century date. The Ordnance Survey first edition 1:2500 plan (Gloucestershire Sheet LXXI.07) published in 1885 records the farmhouse and a number of ancillary buildings, including one which appears to be a barn. Several of these buildings are extant including former outbuildings within the adjacent dairy site.\r\nThe farmhouse has a Grade II listing (Listed Building number 901-1/27/1996)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
