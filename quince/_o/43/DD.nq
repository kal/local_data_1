The buildings housed a warehouse and sail lofts. The facade of the building was an arhythmic collection of doorways and windows which apparently represented the incorporation of a number of earlier buildings into an eighteenth-century facade. The crowns of three hipped pantiled roofs are visible behind the facade. There was also a narrow passage leading to The Shakespeare public house in Prince Street which was incorporated into the frontage and ran between the properties. The site is now void."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
