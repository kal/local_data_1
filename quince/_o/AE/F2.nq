The church shared its tower with St. John the Baptist and was located on the west side of it.\r\nThe church was sold to Henry Brayne during the Dissolution and was later sold again for building land. The parish was amalgamated with that of St. John in 1580. The church building survived until 1963 when it was demolished without record to make way for the construction of No.11 Quay Street. A note relating to drawing BRSMG M2455 in the Braikenridge Collection gives the internal width of the church as 24 feet. The height was given as about 30 feet and the length \"from Present wall to wall\" 54 feet. The walls were noted to be 2 feet 6 inches thick. Braikenridge also noted that the \"old Oak roof\" of the church survived. Various images in the Braikenridge Collection illustrate these features. In 1850, when the building seems to have been used at least in part as a stable, the west wall of the church was extant and contained a blocked doorway, the west window of the church and a stoup."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
