Plumley and Ashmead's 1828 plan of Bristol indicates that the area of the churchyard used for burials was then limited to the area surrounding, and to the south of, the church. By the time of the Ordnance Survey first edition 1:500 plan of the early 1880s the area of the churchyard had expanded to take in the whole of the land parcel bounded by The Fosseway and Clifton Road."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
