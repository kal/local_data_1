The shelter measured 3.86 metres long by 2.33 metres wide and was 2.12 metres high. It was constructed of brick in English bond and had a flat reinforced concrete roof. Narrow metal vents below the roof in the east, south and west walls provided ventilation. The internal toilet with a soil vent pipe was located in the south-east corner of the shelter.\r\nThe shelter was been converted to a storage building after the Second World War by the removal of the internal blast wall of the traverse entry and the insertion of a window in the west facing elevation (Brett 2003).\r\nPhotographs of the shelter are held in the SMR Collection of Ground-based photographs, numbers 1865-1878."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
