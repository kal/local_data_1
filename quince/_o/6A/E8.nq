On the left, or southern, bank of the River Frome, a little upstream of the location of Bridewell Bridge. Served by the weir that Rocque depicted on his 1742 map, which also may show a sluice at the mill end of the same feature. The foundations of the mill are thought to have been found in 1926 during construction of the new Police and Fire Brigade headquarters buildings. It is assumed that the mill is medieval, but it could be of later date."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
