The date of the construction of the Band Stand is currently (04/12/06) unknown but it was in existence by 1904. A circular structure of 6.9 metres, the Ordnance Survey 1:2500-scale County series plan (Somerset sheet VI.06) indicates that it was enclosed by a circular feature of 13.9 metres in diameter, although the form of this enclosure is not clear. By 1954 the Band Stand was no longer recorded by the Ordnance Survey plan, implying that it had been demolished."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
