The gate was a double-arched structure which lay at the southern end of Broad Quay, allowing passage through the town wall known as the Marsh Wall. The gate was excavated in 1979 (BUAD 407) and was found to have been built of Pennant sandstone in a rubble construction and was bonded in a soft, medium-brown sandy mortar. Each stone-paved passageway was roughly 2.5 metres wide, divided by a stone wall 1 metre wide. The remains of the arch survived a little above the level of the paving and investigation of its foundations found that they were 1.8 metres deep. There was no evidence of timber piles supporting this rubble (Price 1990/91).\r\nIt is not clear when the gate was demolished but it is not shown by James Millerd's 1673 map of the city, suggesting that it had been removed by that date."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
