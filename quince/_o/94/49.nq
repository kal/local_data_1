The original medieval structure was replaced by a single gate in the Classical style in 1730 or 1731, probably built on the site of the old outer gate. This was a Classical design with banded rustication on the south face and a tall round-headed central gate with twin studded doors for vehicular traffic. There was a smaller square-headed pedestrian gate to either side. Above the outside of either side gate there was a coved niche, and a smaller niche at the top of the structure, above the main entry. The gate was removed in 1771 to improve traffic flow."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
