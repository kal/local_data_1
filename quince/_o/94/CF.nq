The building was probably constructed in the later seventeenth century as a single bay house of three storeys plus attic with a gabled pantile roof. The building was refronted in brick, probably in the early nineteenth-century. The upper part of the southern wall appears to have been reconstructed in brick at the same time and the rear part of the roof may have been converted to a half hip as part of the same works.\r\nThe building was in dilapidated condition by the late 1990s, with parts of the floor in poor condition. It was subsequently gutted and the roof removed."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
