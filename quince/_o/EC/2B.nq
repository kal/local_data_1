The colliery was in operation by 1854 when the owner was Chick, Keeling & Co. The main shaft (at ST 60199 73978) was 950 feet (290 metres) deep and several seams were worked, including the Kingswood Great seam at  280 feet (85.7 metres), the Kingswood Little seam at 396 feet (121 metres) and the Easton Red Ash at 945 feet (289 metres). Ownership of the colliery seems to have changed every few years in the 1860s and 1870s. By 1865 the pit was owned by Chick, Brown & Co. but it was owned by Thomas Brown in the following year, Brown and Harris in 1868, G. W. Harris in 1874 and the Pennywell Colliery Co. in 1877 (Southway 1971, 20). It was acquired by Leonard, Betts & Boult, which already owned the Easton and Hanham collieries, in 1888, though by 1889 the mine was reported as being used only for pumping and ventilation (Ramsey, 2003 24). The date of closure is unclear but Leonard Boult and Company was wound up in 1894. The site had been cleared of colliery buildings by the time of the Ordnance Survey second edition 1:2500 plan (Gloucestershire Sheet LXXII.13) published in 1903.\r\nThe site was redeveloped for housing in the twentieth century."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
