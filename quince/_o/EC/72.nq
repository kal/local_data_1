The gate was contemporary with the construction of the town wall known as the Portwall (BUAD 1042M) in the thirteenth century. The medieval gate was 9 yards long by 3 yards wide according to William Worcestre (Neale 2000, 10-11). The original gate was demolished in 1734 and a new gate built on the same site in a Classical style. This was drawn by James Stewart in 1751. It had banded rustication on its north face, banded columns at the ends and to either side of central arch, and alternately enlarged voussoirs above pedestrian entrances. There was a tall round-headed wide central gate for vehicular traffic, with smaller round-headed pedestrian gates on either side. Above the centre there was a gabled roof, the gable ends being decorated with the Royal Arms (facing north) and the City Arms (facing south). Temple Gate was removed in 1808-09.\r\nOne of the large urns is preserved in the collections of Bristol Museum and Art Gallery."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
