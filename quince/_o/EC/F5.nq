The brewery was founded in the late 1820s and was recorded by a street directory of 1829 as \"Baynton, Thomas, Charles & John, Brewers, Somerset Brewery, near Ashton gate, Bedminster.\" Thomas Baynton alone was listed as the operator from 1834. By the mid-nineteenth century the brewery consisted of a large main building on North Street with a narrower range of buildings to the rear. Immediately to the souh-west of this range there was a trapezoidal pond measuring approximately 35 metres long by 18 metres wide.\r\nThe brewery was sold to a new registered company, the \"Ashton Gate Brewery Co. Ltd.\" in 1865 and a number of new buildings were constructed. The company changed its name to \"Hardwick & Co.\" between 1868 and 1883 but subsequently reverted to Ashton Gate Brewery. More expansion projects were undertaken including the construction of a new fermenting house in 1903 by George Adlams and Sons, local brewery engineers. In 1909 plans were produced for a new single-storey cellar brick cellar which was built alongside the fermenting house. This had a queen post roof with a lantern running along the centre. The Ashton Gate Brewery was purchased by George's and Co. in 1932 and closed down."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
