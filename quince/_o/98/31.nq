The pottery was in existence by the 1740s and the buildings appear to have survived into the mid-1820s. \r\nIn 1742 the pottery was owned by Daniel Saunders, followed by George Hart in 1773 and then operated by Stephen Fricker in 1775. By 1788 the Yabbicom family were paying rates for the property until they moved the business to Avon Street in 1795-7 and closed the Sugar House Pottery (Jackson 2005, 129).\r\nAdverts in the Felix Farley journal indicate that the pottery was producing sugar moulds, flower pots and chimney pots in 1775 (Jackson 2005, 127).\r\nAn early nineteenth century plan depicts a building called the 'Pot House' to the east of the road between Westbury and Bristol (BRO 32690(47), Jackson 2005, 123, fig 2). A lease of 1832 (BRO 21782, box 17, bundle 6) describes the various buildings of the former pottery that included a pothouse, coachhouse, stable, other buildings and yard. A plan dated 1829 attached to the lease indicates the location of the buildings (Jackson 2005, 123, fig.3) the boundary walls of which can be traced on the 1880s Ordnance Survey plan, although by this time the pottery had been demolished. This indicates that the main pothouse building lay on the site of the present nos.137-139 Westbury Road with the adjoining yard and outbuildings lying to the rear and beneath the existing nos.141-143."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
