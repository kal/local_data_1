The factory was in existence by 1828 and continued in existence to the early twentieth century. The factory consisted of three buildings, running back in a line from Temple Gate. The site now lies beneath the Holiday Inn Express hotel and Franklin Court and the archaeological stratification is likely to have been seriously disrupted."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
