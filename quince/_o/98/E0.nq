The house was originally known as \"Ivy Lodge\" and was the lodge to Grove House. In 1830, Richard Ricketts (of the family residing at Grove House) is recorded as living there. In 1843, John Cox, a tanner from Bristol, came to live there, and in the Brislington Tithe Survey of 1846 he is recorded as being the occupier with Henry Ricketts as the owner. There were a succession of tenants, including from 1880 to 1885 John and Caroline Brookman who ran a school on the premises. A long drive ran northwards from an entrance in Bristol Hill to the house, stable and yard. In 1904 Harold Almond set up the \"Derry Hand Laundry\" which was taken over in 1908 by James Galley and continued to be used as a laundry, until at least 1948 (SMR 20571). In 1959, it was sold by the Galley family to Mr. R. Verrecchia who converted the building into flats."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
