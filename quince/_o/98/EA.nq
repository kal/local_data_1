The semi-circular bastion (BUAD 182A) was an element of the second town wall, projecting to the River Frome. The structure was still extant in the early-nineteenth century, and was noted to be \"still almost perfect\" by the antiquarian Samuel Seyer in 1821, who also commented that the \"brass workshop of Mr W[asborough] is built upon it\" (Seyer 1821, 269)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
