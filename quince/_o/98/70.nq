The colliery was in existence by the time of the St. George tithe survey of 1842 (BRO EP/A/32/32) when it was recorded as Starveall Coal Works. The colliery was acquired by Cossham and Wethered Ltd. In 1863 and was run by the Kingswood Coal and Iron Company Ltd. from 1867. It was reported by Warne that the shaft cut Doxall Seam, Upper Toad Seam, Hole Seam, Lower Five Coals Seam, Thurfer Seam, Great Vein Seam, Gillers Inn Seam and Lower Toad Seam. In the late 1920s another seam, the Two Foot Seam, was proved. Of these only Lower Five Coals Seam, the Great Vein Seam, Gllers Inn Seam and the Two Coals Seam were worked. According to Warne, the tip was \"allowed to burn and the material turns a nice red colour and is removed for making paths etc.\" (Warne 1935-39, 308).\r\nThe colliery closed c1936 (Warne 1935-39, 306) and the site was subsequently redeveloped."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
