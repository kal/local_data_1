The brewery was constructed in the mid-nineteenth century and in the 1860s belonged to Foll and Abbott. It comprised a main building on the southern side of the junction of Stokes Croft and City Road with a malthouse (BUAD 1611M) and store to the south-east on Upper York Street. It was acquired by Harvey and Co. in the 1870s and was still in their ownership in 1882. By 1896, however, the brewery belonged to R. W. Miller and Co. Limited but in 1911 it was taken over by George's and Co. Ltd. along with its forty-eight public houses."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
