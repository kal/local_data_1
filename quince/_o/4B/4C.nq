Human activity began on the site in the eleventh century when the surrounding area was still saltmarsh and occupation continued into the twentieth century (Insole 1997). The ditches around the site surrounding the site had been repeatedly recut during the medieval and post-medieval periods and contained both food remains and pottery. The food material included wheat, barley and oats from the eleventh-century and Celtic beans from the twelfth. The most of the medieval pottery was local, including wares from Ham Green and other potteries in south Gloucestershire. The only evidence for medieval structures recovered were fragments of daub suggesting the presence of timber structures, presumably roofed with thatch. Some lias limestone was, however, noted across the site and this may have been imported as a building material for an early post-medieval stone building. The most substantial building was an \"L-shaped\" building recorded by the Ordnance Survey first edition plan (Gloucestershire Sheet LXVII.06) published in 1881. This measured 13 metres north-west to south east and 8 metres south-west to north-east and lay at the northern end of a rectangular enclosure, apparently a garden, which measured 40 metres south-west to north-east by 25 metres. The building was extant in 1920 but had been demolished by 1955."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
