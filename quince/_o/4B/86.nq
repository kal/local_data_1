Carriage access was from the south-eastern return to stables at the rear, which included a carriage turntable.\r\nThe public entrance was at the centre of the façade and visitors walked up a flight of steps to the first-floor lobby. On the north-western side of the stair at the front of the building was a conference hall and an office on its south-east side. The lobby extended along the centre of the building and there was a large sale room at its northern end. On the north-west sideof the lobby was a bar and restaurant, and on its south-east side a club room with a large bay overlooking the Christ Church churchyard on the south side of the building and another bar.\r\nThe entrance was relocated slightly to the north-west in the early twentieth century and the interior was also extensively altered later in the century. While the front element of the building dates to the 1860s, some of the fabric towards the rear may be reused from earlier structures. A fourteenth-century well survives in the basement towards the rear of the building.\r\nThe building has a Grade II listing (Listed Building number 901-1/11/537)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
