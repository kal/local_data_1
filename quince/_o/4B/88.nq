The building was erected in 1839 and was built in a Gothic Revival style. The main building was of stone and had two storeys. The main range, parallel to Queen's Road had at least five bays and there was a square three-storey tower occupying the second bay from the north. There were crenellations around the top of this and along the  roof. At the north end was a wing projecting forward towards the road which may have contained the chapel. An organ was built for the School by John Smith junior of the Bristol organ builders John Smith and Sons in 1838 (Bristol Mirror, 17 August 1839). There was a large grassed area in front, with a driveway leading from a main gate in front of the chapel block.\r\nThe building was used at the end of its life as the Bishop's College and was demolished in the early-twentieth century to make way for the Bristol Art Gallery."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
