The edges of the estate can be identified until the later post-medieval period and probably included St. Michael's Church, forming an association of great house and church which can be seen in many rural locations.\r\nThe land was owned by the Cheddre family and later passed into the ownership of the Lisle's. It was bought by the city and then into the Stubbs family who built a lodge or summerhouse [BUAD 1143M] (ie. a second residence) there in the seventeenth century. The land passed into the hands of the Earle family who began to divide it into gardens (R. Leech pers. comm.)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
