The building was a single-bay house apparently constructed of Pennant sandstone rubble in the seventeenth-century. The building was subsequently remodelled, possibly in the eighteenth-century or early nineteenth-century, when the walls above basement-level were reconstructed. A hipped roof may also have been added at this time. The building was substantially rebuilt in the late-nineteenth or early-twentieth century. In March and April 2003 a further programme of alterations was carried out.\r\nPhotographs of the interior of the building taken during the repair and alteration works in 2003 are held in the Sites and Monuments Record Collection of Ground-based Photographs."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
