The footprint of the building measured 23.25 metres from south-east to north-west and was 17 metres wide. The main, south-west facing, elevation was of ashlar and had three bays. The ground-floor was rusticated with segmental-headed arched windows in the northern and southern bays on either side of a porch over the main entrance in the central bay. This had a wide frieze supported by twinned Roman Doric columns at the north-western and south-western corners. The first floor was plain and there had three arched windows and above these there was a pediment with the date \"1815\" at the centre. On either side of the main element of the facade there was a narrow recessed strip with identical incised decoration at ground- and first-floor. Behind the parapet the building had a hipped roof and there was also a gable at the eastern end. On the northern and southern ends of the elevation there were square two-storey structures, slightly set back from the main elevation, but apparently part of the original design. Each had a central door at ground floor and a single arched window above. An organ was built for the church by John Smith of the Bristol organ builders John Smith and Sons (although it is not clear whether this was John Smith senior or John Smith junior) in 1836. It was enlarged by John Smith junior in 1845.\r\nThe building was demolished in 1957 to make way for the development of the Broadmead shopping centre. The congregation moved to Cairns Road, and retained the \"Old King Street\" name."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The churchyard was located on the southern side of All Saint's Court, opposite the church. It was apparently expanded slightly sometime after 1470. The boundary line between Nos.42 and 43 High Street provided one corner in 1470 but subsequent evidence shows that a strip (the width of No.43 High Street) was added. There is also reference to an entrance stile in 1531. The churchyard was still extant in the early eighteenth-century (Leech 1997, 1) but the site was subsequently developed with housing. The churchyard and All Saints Court was formally closed to interment by an Order in Council of 18 February 1854 made under the Burial Act of 1852.\r\nThe site of the cemetery lies beneath Nos.2 and 3 All Saints' Court and beneath the northern half of No.6 All Saints' Lane. No.2 All Saints Court is cellared, though only beneath the core of the building. It is a reasonable assumption, therefore, that surviving undisturbed inhumations of medieval and later date may be anticipated in the area of the former cemetery."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
