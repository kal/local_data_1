The colliery was established in 1845 and had two shafts located towards the eastern part of the site (ST 58332 71686 and ST 58335 71678 approximately). These were sunk to 630 feet (193 metres) intially and the depth was later increased to 1290 feet (395 metres). The galleries extended into east Bristol (Southway 1976, 5-6). In 1886 eleven men were killed by an explosion in the mine (Ramsey 2003, 12).\r\nThe mine was run by the Bedminster, Easton, Kingswood and Parkfield Collieries Ltd. from the early twentieth century until the pit was closed in 1906 (Ramsey 2003, 20-21). Dame Emily Smyth Park has been developed on the site of the colliery."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
