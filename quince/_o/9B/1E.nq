The canal was in existence by the time of the St. George tithe survey of 1842 (BRO EP/A/32/32) which indicates that it was cut right across St. Philip's Marsh to connect the Feeder Canal at its northern end to the River Avon at its southern. It is believed to have been constructed to divert river traffic around Netham Dam. The canal was orientated from north-east to south-west and had an entrance lock from the River Avon approximately 60 metres long at its southern end. The dock itself measured some 160 metres long by 30 metres wide. By 1882 when the Ordnance Survey first edition 1:500 plan (Bristol Sheet LXXII.1.5) was surveyed the dock was out of use. This plan does not record any dock walls and suggests that the dock itself may have been in the process of silting up. By 1904 the dock had been infilled and the site redeveloped for the Netham Constructional Steel Works (Lord & Southam 1983, 48)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
