The building was constructed in the mid-1660s apparently as the western of a group of three, the lease for the plots of Nos.16-18 being granted by the Bristol Corporation to Francis Bayley, a shipwright, in 1663 (BRO 04335(5) fo.4). This lease set a limit of three years for construction, suggesting that the three buildings had probably been completed by 1666. The building was refenestrated in the eighteenth-century and restored in the late twentieth-century.\r\nThe house has a Grade II* listing (Listed Building number 901-1/16/603)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
