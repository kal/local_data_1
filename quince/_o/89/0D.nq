The chapel was established in 1794-95 by members of the New Room congregation who seceded after a dispute with the New Room trustees over the requirement for communion to be administered by an ordained minster.\r\nThe building was a two-storey structure with a half-hipped roof and measured 23.8 metres from east to west by 18.7 metres wide.\r\nThe main, east-facing, elevation of the building was of five bays with a pediment, shaped parapet, and two tiers of semi-circular arched windows. The central bay at ground floor level had a single-storey gabled porch with an arched doorway and on each side were two arched windows. The first floor held five identical arched windows and above these was a pediment with a central relief plaque. The chapel was separated from Old King Street by a low wall with iron railings along it (Bristol Reference Library E400). The gallery extended around all four sides of the interior.\r\nThe interior was partly refitted in 1859 (Stell 1986, 70) and the Ordnance Survey 1:500-scale town plan (Bristol Sheet LXXI.16.20) surveyed in 1882 and revised in 1894 records that the chapel could then accommodate 900 worshippers.\r\nThe chapel was closed in 1954 and demolished soon afterwards to make way for the redevelopment of Broadmead."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
