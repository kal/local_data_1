The feature was recorded in a vertical air photograph taken by the Royal Air Force on 23 March 1946 (RAF/106G/UK/1288 Frame 5262) and was enclosed by an earth bank approximately 16 metres in diameter with a circular central depression with contiguous rectangular features surrounding it. The function of the feature is unknown but it appears likely to be a defensive feature dating to the Second World War. The feature had been destroyed by the end of March 1955 (RAF/540/1576 frames 94 and 170)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
