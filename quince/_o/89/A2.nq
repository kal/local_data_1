Situated on the east side of St Michael's Hill and south side of Myrtle Road. Built in the late eighteenth century, the building is extant and comprises a three-storey three window range constructed of rendered limestone rubble with limestone dressings and a pantile single-pile roof.\r\nOriginally a two storey structure the third floor was added in the late nineteenth century as evidenced by surviving stone copping along the north side of the building above first-floor window level.\r\nInternally, very few pre-twentieth century features survive. The eighteenth century staircase survives, though much altered and the original newel post has been removed. In the hall is a metal fanlight with later coloured glass, an eighteenth century arch with reeded pilasters, a further three-centered arch and a reeded cornice to the rear hall and a late Georgian (now) half-glazed door to the rear. \r\nThe building was first depicted on Donne's map of Bristol, printed in 1826. The 1:500 Ordnance Survey plan of 1885 shows that the building had been extended to the rear and a square bay added to the rear of the original building..\r\nAfter the Second World War the building became a Nurses' Home and was subdivided into flats.\r\nThe building is Listed Grade II (Listed Building number 901-1/4/274)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
