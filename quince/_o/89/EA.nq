The farm was in existence by the time of the tithe survey of Horfield and at that date the farm comprised three substantial buildings, though none is indicated to be a dwelling. It was also recorded by the Ordnance Survey first edition 1:2500 plan (Gloucestershire Sheet LXXII.05) published in 1881 and this shows a similar arrangement of buildings. The farm survived into the twentieth century but it had been demolished by the mid 1930s and the site redeveloped."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
