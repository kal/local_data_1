The building appears to have been constructed in the seventeenth century. It was orientated north-east to south-west and stood in a large formal garden. The building survived into the early twentieth century but was subsequently demolished and the site redeveloped for apartments. The site of the building now lies largely to the north and west of the apartment blocks however."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
