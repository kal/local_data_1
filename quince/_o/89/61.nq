The house, located on the southern side of Ellbroad Street, was the western of a pair of gabled houses (the other was No.4 Ellbroad Street (BUAD 1297M)) of late seventeenth century date with jettied fronts, and \"lean-to shelters over the entrances\" (i.e. a common pentice roof between the ground and first floors). The building had a single bay and was of three storeys plus attic and cellar. the ground-floor was occupied by shop windows, the front entrances being adjacent. The gable ends rested on brackets and the building may have been cross-gabled. The house was demolished in 1906, along with 'The Rising Sun' public house (BUAD 151M), in order to construct enlarged licensed premises (which, in turn, were removed in 1954).\r\nThe site of the building now lies under the footway on the west side of Lower Castle Street and is therefore likely to have been disturbed by services to some extent."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
