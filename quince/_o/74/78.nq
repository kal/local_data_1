The pond lay to the south-east on Cutler's Mill (SMR 21848) and appears to have been originally at least 160 metres long. By 1828 it was largely silted up and the south-eastern end had been incorporated into Rennison's Bath."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
