The building was a two-storey podium standing over a lake designed by the American firm Skidmore, Owings and Merrill. It was constructed between 1970 and 1975 and has been noted as the most ambitious use of COR-TEN steel in England. It was the European Headquarters office building for Wills (Aldous 1979, 28).\r\nIn 1999 to 2000 the office building was stripped of asbestos, and the concrete partition walls, lift shafts and other elements of the structure were removed at the same time to leave only the COR-TEN steel frame and the floor slabs standing.\r\nThe building has a Grade II listing (Listed Building number 901-1/57/10063)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
