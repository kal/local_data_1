The garden, apparently walled and raised above the level of the courtyard of the main house, lay to the north of the house, its northern edge against Trenchard Lane. This original garden seems to have survived as long as the house itself, although the planting scheme is unknown.\r\nAfter the construction of the house was complete Sir John Young began a piecemeal acquisition of plots on the north side of Trenchard Street to create a large garden on the hillside above the house (Roger Leech pers. comm.). Two lodges, the Red Lodge and the White Lodge marked the northern corners of this garden.\r\nThe gardens were developed for housing in the later eighteenth century. A small part survives as the garden of the Red Lodge, and a replica Elizabethan formal garden has been established there."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
