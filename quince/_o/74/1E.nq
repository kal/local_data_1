A square, three-storey structure with a single room on each floor. The remains of the building were identified by Roger Leech in 1998 (4461) at which time three walls of the building survived. The partial remains of the south elevation was constructed of coursed white lias at ground floor level, the upper floors were constructed of Flemish bonded brickwork. The building was apparently constructed in the later eighteenth century and by 1828 had been extended to the east. All structures on the site were demolished in c.1975."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
