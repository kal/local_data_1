The house lay on the northern side of Pennywell Road, immediately to the south of the E. Baily and Son malt house. It was recorded by the Ordnance Survey 1st edition map of 1883 and by the Goad fire insurance plan of August 1896. The building was still extant in the mid-1950s but has since been demolished. The site is not known to have been disturbed since demolition and the archaeological stratification associated with the monument is therefore likely to survive in good condition."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
