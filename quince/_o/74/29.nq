The house was one of seven built by Thomas Powell in the late 1780s and seems to have comprised a single room on each floor. The building was of brick and the west wall appears to survive in the fabric of the former garage No.101 Redcliff Street. A description of the court in 1850 states that the floors of the ground-floor rooms of the dwellings were below the then ground level."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
