The features suggest a deserted farm site at the south-west end of a trackway on Hallen Marsh. A survey of the area of 1773 shows a small enclosure, while the tithe survey of 1841 records a \"House, Homestead & Orchard\". The farm is shown on the Ordnance Survey maps of 1881 and 1915, and a pond lies to the south-east.\r\nTrial excavation by Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust in 1991 revealed that the farm buildings were arranged around three sides of a yard. Mortared walls, largely of stone but with later brick additions, were revealed. Floor surfaces were found variously of flags, cobbles or beaten earth. Unstratified post-medieval pottery was found with one medieval sherd. The pond was surveyed. It may have served as part of a fishponds complex. It was partly backfilled but was originally much more substantial. A trial trench was also cut through the shallow bank which enclosed the farm on the south-east. No evidence was found for features associated with the construction of the bank. Pollen preservation was shown to be poor.\r\nThe site (Area 1; Site 12) was visited by R. G. Jackson during the course of a desk-based assessment (SMR 20081) of areas of Bristol City Council owned land north of Avonmouth in December 1996. The site is covered by debris, some derived from the farm itself. The pond is extant. A platform measuring approximately 25 metres by 50 metres was observed to the west of the house site."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
