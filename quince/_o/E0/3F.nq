Bacon Curers, located on the northern side of Waterloo Road, Old Market. A building later occupied by the firm was recorded by the Ordnance Survey first edition 1:500 plan (Bristol Sheet LXXII.13.17) but this does not give any indication of its use at that time. The Goad Fire Insurance plan of August 1896 indicates that Henry Naish & Sons Bacon Curers then occupied the building and an extension had been added to the southern end.\r\nThe buildings of the bacon curers have been demolished and a new structure at the centre of the site."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
