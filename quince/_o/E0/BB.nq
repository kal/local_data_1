The building was of late seventeenth century date with a frontage of thirteen feet. The house was demolished on 29 May 1900 and was this observed by John Pritchard (BUAD 199).\r\nThe frontage of the building is beneath Thomas Lane and the rear beneath the extant brick building which replaced it. The likely state of preservation of associated deposits is unknown but foundations and possibly  stratification may survive beneath the lane."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
