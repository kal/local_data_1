Subsequent Ordnance Survey plans do not mark the quarry suggesting that it went out of use in the 1890s or early in the twentieth century. The 1889 plan shows several trees in and around the quarry suggesting that it was already disused or going out of use.\r\nThe quarry is still extant partially within the garden of No.13 Millbank Close and to the rear of modern garages. Several structures possibly associated with the quarry are also shown on the 1889 plan and the earlier tithe map suggesting that the quarry was in use for at least the majority of the nineteenth century. Some of these structures are also still extant, although their original functions are unknown."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
