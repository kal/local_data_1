The brickyard is recorded by the Ordnance Survey first edition 1:2500 plan (Gloucestershire Sheet LXXII.10) published in 1882. This shows a pair of parallel rectangular buildings 2 metres apart, the southern measuring 13 metres from south-west to north-east and 5 metres from south-east to north-west while the northern measured 10 metres by 3 metres. The plan, however, gives no indication of the functions of the building.\r\nThe site of the brickyard buildings is now largey beneath the rear garden of No.4 Fromeside Park."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
