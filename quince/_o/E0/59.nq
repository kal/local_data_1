The windmill was a tower mill measuring 6 metres in diameter and stood over 7 metres high. It was apparently constructed in the eighteenth century. The structure is likely to have been built of stone rubble and originally had at least two small sash windows in its eastern side, at first and second storey level.\r\nWinstone (1971 pl.134) reports that the sails and other superstructure was removed in 1850 by Mr S. Plenty who converted the mill to a dwelling. It was recorded by the Ordnance Survey first edition 1:500 plan (Bristol Sheet LXXII.13.2) surveyed in 1883 which shows the structure at the northern end of Old Albion Court. By that date it was attached on the south to a rectangular building. A photograph from the 1920s (Winstone, 1971 pl.134) shows the tower and a single-storey rendered building with a lean-to pantile roof, presumably built by Plenty, attached to the south.\r\nThe remaining element of the mill was demolished in the later 1930s (Winstone, 1971 pl.134) and its site subsequently redeveloped. The site of the mill now lies on the western side of a shed on the west side of the junction of Pennywell Road and Easton Way."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
