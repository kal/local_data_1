The Corporation ordered the erection of the bridge across the Frome, from Christmas Street to Lewin's Mead on 5 September 1757. It was a single span arch of stone construction and had ramped parapets with coping. A string course roughly indicating the road level behind the parapet.\r\nA number of buildings, now demolished, were constructed on the bridge and there are rentals for them in the Bristol Record Office. The bridge was presumably incorporated into the culvert when this section of the Frome was covered in the later nineteenth century. In other places the culvert was built to butt against the bridge and it is therefore possible that the arch of the bridge has been preserved."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
