The products of the pottery have received attention since the existence of the pottery was brought to a wider audience by Hugh Owen (1873), and its history has since been addressed by others, notably W. J. Pountney (1920) and Oliver Kent (1996).\r\nThe pottery was founded by John Bissicke, who had connections to the Southwark potteries, and Ralph Bennett in the 1650s. By the 1680s Edward Ward had taken over the pottery. It was advertised for sale in the Oracle Country Advertiser on 26 October 1745 when it was described as \"consisting of a Messuage, Pot-house and sundery Close of Ground, the whole now lett at 55l. 12s. per annum....\"\r\nArchaeological excavations by W. J. Pountney in 1914 (SMR 20221) revealed the foundations of kilns on the south and north sides of the chapel and the stables and other outbuildings extending to the north.\r\nKent argues that three phases of development can be discerned in both the documentary record and the products of the pottery. The first phase, the founding and operation of the pottery by Bissicke and Bennett when pieces bearing simple geometric or brush decoration were produced, was followed by a second from 1679. Pieces bearing the simple geometric designs continued to be produced but there was a shift to figurative and political designs. The third phase began in the late 1740s, after the pottery had been sold, when with new investment in technology it began to produce red wares (Kent 1996, 80-81)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
