The enclosure is sub-triangular in shape and covers about 5 acres of the north west corner of Coombe Hill. It is bounded on the north by the cliff edge of the gorge of the River Trym, and on the east side by a bank up to 1.5 metres high with an external ditch. On the south west side is a slight bank with only fragmentary remains of a ditch. At present the function of the enclosure is uncertain. Nor is there any dating evidence for the enclosure, although it is believed to be of likely Iron Age date. Burrow (1981 232-233) allocates the monument to his Group II.\r\nThe enclosure was first observed by E. K. Tratman (1946, 178). In February 1967 a survey of the monument was undertaken by J. W. Haldane, Mr. A. Waller and Ms. M. Robinson (Haldane in Anon. 1965-68, 249-251) (SMR 22010). Burrow visited the site in early February 1973 and noted that the earthworks were very eroded and had been lost entirely along the south side. He also noted possible entrances in both the east and west sides of the enclosure (Burrow 1981, 232-233)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
