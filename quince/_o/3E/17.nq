The kiln was a perpetual or draw-kiln roughly 5.7 metres square and was built of stone bonded in a white lime mortar with a brick lined furnace. In the base were four arched passages to allow the lime to be removed from the kiln, and two of these were found to be blocked with clay. The surviving base of the kiln stood 1 metre high (Good, 1987 66-69)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
