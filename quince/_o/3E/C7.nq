The house was of two storeys with a double gable in the jettied north elevation. The ground-floor of the north elevation had, from the east, a window, entrance, and two windows. The first-floor window beneath the end of the central valley. Jettying cut back at very east end. The east elevation had a left-hand entrance with a two-light window beneath relieving arch. There was a blocked window to left of centre at first-floor; the chimney stack was near northern end, with a possible dormer behind it. There was a small terrace-like feature outside northern ground-floor. \r\nThe site now lies mainly under the pavement on the south side of Broad Weir but was in the highway between the late nineteenth century and the 1960s. Services are likely therefore to have disturbed the site."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
