Four bronze pillars set in the footway in front of The Exchange on the southern side of Corn Street (at ST 58858 73022, ST 58848 73017, ST 58841 73012 and ST 58834 73007) which were used for trading: according to Pryce (Anon., 1859 275) \"upon them our merchants of a former day paid for their purchases . Hence, I believe, originated the phrase, 'pay down upon the nail'. Vignettes in the border Millerd's 1673 map of Bristol indicate that at that date there were nine Nails, three between the columns supporting the pentice of the Tolzey on the north side of Corn Street, and the remainder beneath a similar structure in front of All Saint's Church on the opposite side of the street. The four surviving pillars are reported to have been moved to their present position in 1782 (Anon., 1859 276).\r\nThere appears to have been very little archaeological study of the Nails, the only known detailed record being the drawings by Lepard made in the late 1850s (BUAD 3716; Anon., 1858 340-341). The surviving pillars date to the late-sixteenth and early-seventeenth century and three bear inscriptions commemorating their donors. The earliest, at the north-east end of the group, is undated but has been dated on stylistic grounds to the late-Elizabethan period. The remainder date to between 1625 and 1631.\r\nThe Nails have a Grade I listing (Listed Building number 901-1/11/580)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
