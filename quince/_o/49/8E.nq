The house was in existence by the early 1740s and stood at the south-eastern corner of a walled garden extending from Kingsdown Parade to the road to the north. It was recorded by Jean Rocque's 1742 map of Bristol and was probably a merchant's garden house or lodge (ie. second residence). The building measured 8.5 metres from south-east to north-west and was 7 metres wide. It had been apparently been demolished by 1828."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
