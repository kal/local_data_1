The building opened in 1801. As a result of the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834 the poor house became part of the Clifton Poor Law Union. The building was recorded by the St. George tithe survey of 1842 (BRO EP/A/32/32) which indicated that the residential component of the poor house was on the south side of the structure while the northern element consisted of a range of buildings around the sides of a central yard.\r\nA larger poor house was developed at Fishponds Road, Eastville in 1847 and this subsequently expanded, making the Hudd's Vale Road site redundant. By the early 1870s John Ellis was operating an earthenware pottery (SMR 20967) in the buildings and this was recorded by the Ordnance Survey first edition 1:2500 plan (Gloucestershire Sheet LXXII.14) surveyed in 1880-81. The buildings of the poor house seem to have been extant at that date but were subsequently demolished and the site redeveloped as a soapworks (SMR 20969)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
