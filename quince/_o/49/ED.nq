The inn occupied roughly the area of St. Nicholas Market with an entrance off St. Nicholas Street. It was in existence by 1468 when it was part of the estate of Sir Walter Rodney, and ownership subsequently passed through several hands. The site was extensive and there are references in sixteenth century to a stables and tenements. The site was cleared c.1740 to enable the building of the Exchange and the new market behind.\r\nCellars of the inn survive beneath the The Crown Inn in All Saints' Lane. Other elements of the inn and its associated buildings are likely to survive below ground."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
