It was a three-bay house of at least two storeys with a steeply pitched roof. It was probably constructed of stone rubble and was of late-medieval or early post-medieval date. Hudd (1884-88) believed that the structure was part of the Hospital of St. Katherine (SMR 905).\r\nThe building was demolished in February 1887 and the site redeveloped for the W. H. & H. O. Wills Tobacco Factory (SMR 5494)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
