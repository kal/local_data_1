The building, designed by the Bristol architect W. H. Watkins, was built on the site in 1909-1910 for the Bristol Tramways & Carriage Co. The building is a single-storey structure of rendered brick with hipped and gable roofs. At the north-west corner there is a circular turret with the arms of the Bristol Tramways company moulded on the exterior below the eaves of the roof. In 1911 a small structure was constructed on the south side of the garage building to provide a pavilion for tennis courts which occupied part of the remainder of the site. The building remained in the ownership of the Bristol Tramways company until the early 1950s when it became the premises of Welch & Co. Ltd., \"motor car agents & d[ea]l[e]rs.\"\r\nThe building has a Grade II listing (Listed Building number 901-1/28/2094)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
