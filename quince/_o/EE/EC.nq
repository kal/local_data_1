The building originally had two chimneys \"each 180 f[ee]t high and 9 f[ee]t across the inside of the base\" (Buchanan & Cossons, 1969 168-169). At the eastern end was the engine room and the hoist still survives (Boore, 1994 3). The building was in use as a store for South Western Electricity Board into the 1980s. Only the west part of the station (fronting Temple Back) now survives, however, the block adjacent to the Floating Harbour having been demolished in 1991.\r\nThe building has a single storey and nineteen bays. The facade is of red brick with window mouldings of Bath stone and Pennant Sandstone while the decorative lower facings are of Granite."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
