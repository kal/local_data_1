The building was located at the corner of Counterslip and the east side of Hawkins Lane. It was an attached building of three storeys and attic with a gabled front to Counterslip and dated to the seventeenth century. Jettied; timber-framed. Figure bracket or caryatid on decorated post at corner; bracket and decorated post at eastern end. Entrance on left; to right, sash window with shutters, set in possible brick ground-floor wall. First and second floors similar, with central bays with Ipswich windows and glazed sides, and 6-light transomed windows to each side of bays. Bay to attic storey, transomed, 6-lights to front. Tall brick stacks against east side.\r\nThe building presented a side elevation of three gables to Hawkins Lane. There were doors and windows to ground-floor, with some brick infilling below the latter. The cellar entrance was on this side. The first-floor was the only storey jettied and there was a bracket at the north end. In the upper storeys there were windows in the left and centre bays only. \r\nThe inn is reported to have been once much frequented by persons in the 'Guinea Trade' and John Hodges was licensee in 1821. The house next door (east), which had a \"very curious old front,\" was pulled down c.1800 (Braikenridge Notes). By the 1820s was a warehouse used by the Kennet and Avon Canal Company. The building survived into the 1850s and was photographed by Hugh Owen (Winstone, 1970 pls.48-49)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
