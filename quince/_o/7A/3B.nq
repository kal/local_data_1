At ground floor the north-facing elevation contained a bay window, the second floor a sash and the gable end a four-light casement. A single-flue chimney stack projected from gable end. The cross-gable roof was pantiled.\r\nThe building was probably demolished during the removal of Steep Street at the end of the 1860s as part of the remodelling of the road pattern in this part of the city."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
