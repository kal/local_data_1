A company was formed by Charles W. Poole to construct a new music hall. A site on Old Market Street was chosen. The building was designed by the architects Wylson and Long . Construction started in March 1892 and the theatre opened on 6 November 1893 (Sachs & Woodrow 1896, 46). In 1897 the Empire became one of the first theatres in Bristol to show moving pictures. These were limited runs of shows within the normal music hall nightly programme. Between 1931 and 1939 the building became the Empire Cinema (Anderson 1983, 8). The theatre later became the BBC Theatre. It was demolished in the 1963 to make way for the Old Market Underpass."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
