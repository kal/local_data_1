The statue is a standing bronze figure of Earl Haig (1861-1928) in the uniform of an officer of the British Army, wearing a greatcoat and resting a map case, held in the left hand, on the left knee. The statue is set on a small rectangular plinth of Portland stone approximately 1 metre high with the legend \"HAIG\" carved into its south-east face. The figure was sculpted by W. McMillan (also responsible, with Charles Wheeler for mermen and mermaids on the Trafalgar Square fountains in London) and was cast by the A. B. Burton foundry at Thames Ditton in 1931 (Merritt 2002, 41-42). Haig had attended Clifton College between 1875 and 1879 and, pursuing a military career, succeeded Sir John French as Commander in Chief British Expeditionary Forces in December 1915. Haig retained that command until 1919. He became commander of Home Forces after the First World War, founded the Haig Fund and was subsequently created the first Earl Haig. The statue was unveiled on Saturday 15th July 1932 by Sir William Birdwood, former commander of the ANZAC forces and a Clifton College alumnus, in a ceremony also attended by Sir Francis Younghusband (1863-1942), another Clifton College alumnus.\r\nThe statue has a Grade II listing (Listed Building number 901-1/832)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
