This was a two storey rendered building with a single pitched roof and rectangular bay at the south end of west front. Assymetrical front façade with door slightly north of centre. When the property was surveyed in 2005 most of the internal fixtures and fittings were modern replacements with the exception of the single curving stairs that had original square spindles and a handrail that terminated with a scroll on the ground floor. The building was demolished for new hospital buildings in 2006."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
