The forges were located behind the Ropewalk at Wapping, on the site of the later New Gaol (BUAD 63M). A drawing of 1806 shows a timber shed with hipped roof with several chimneys or vents, and, a short distance to the right, a kiln or kiln-like chimney. These were presumably temporary structures which were dismantled after work on the New Cut was complete."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
