The rebuilt Baptist chapel on the south side of the original route of Counterslip. The chapel was founded in 1810 and rebuilt in 1839. It was damaged by bombing during the second World War and dismantled after the war. The Classical-looking block on the corner with Temple Street and Philip Street possessed a hipped roof, whereas the roof of the main chapel, at least in later years, was hipped with a gablet. The site now lies beneath the Keg Store of Courage's Brewery."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
