The building is a large town house built c.1760 for Joseph Harford. According to the listing  it is one of a number of houses modelled on Clifton Hill House, 1750 and was probably designed by Thomas Paty. The three-storey building is of limestone ashlar and squared, coursed Pennant rubble, with rendered gable stacks and a slate mansard roof. It has a double-depth plan. It is built on a slope with the front set back from the basement. The rusticated ground floor has incised voussoirs and a plat band, pilasters from there to a cornice and parapet, raised on the taller centre to the height of the pediment, with ball finials.\r\nThe building became the Convent of Our Lady of Mercy in 1846 and a chapel was built on the west side of frontage. This had a single-bay frontage with an arcade of five romanesque arched windows above a rusticated band. Above a string course was a three-light lunette window above which the pitched roof had a broken pediment. The chapel had rusticated quoins. The chapel has been demolished, although the rusticated courses of the frontage survive in the boundary wall surrounding Harford House.\r\nHarford House has been converted into flats.\r\nThe building has a Grade II listing (Listed building number 901-1/5/1477)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
