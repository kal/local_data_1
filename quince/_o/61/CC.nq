The slipway was in existence by the later seventeenth century and is shown, unnamed, by James Millerd's maps of Bristol of 1670 and 1673. Jean Rocque's 1742 plan of the city shows it descending southwards to the water. The slipway is first named on an undated plan of probable late eighteenth-century date (BRO 04479(1), fo.28-29) as \"Bridgewater Slip\", and as \"Bridge Water Slip\" on a plan of 1783 (BRO 04779(2), fo.87b)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/local_data_1/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
